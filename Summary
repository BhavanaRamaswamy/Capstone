How can a Wellness Company play it Smart?
In this case study, I will perform data analysis for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. I will analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. My analysis will help guide future marketing strategies for the team. Along the way, I will perform numerous real-world tasks of a junior data analyst by following the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
